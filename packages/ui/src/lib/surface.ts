/**
 * Flat material recipes.
 *
 * Flat mode has its own material system, parallel to (and never mixed with)
 * the glasscn library that powers Glass mode. Components must compose these
 * recipes instead of hand-rolling `border bg-card shadow-sm`, so every surface
 * belongs to one coherent physical family:
 *
 *   face-*  (the wash painted on the surface)
 *   + shadow-*  (edge ring + top highlight + lower shade + ambient lift)
 *
 * The edge is deliberately NOT a `border`: it is an inset ring inside the
 * shadow stack, so it hugs whatever radius the element already has — plain
 * `rounded-*` or Klice's `.squircle` — and reads as part of the material
 * rather than a drawn rectangle. That is also why the recipes below almost
 * never contain a border utility.
 *
 * The tokens live in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
