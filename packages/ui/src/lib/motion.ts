/**
 * Klice motion vocabulary.
 *
 * One language, shared by CSS transitions and Motion animations. Components
 * must never inline a raw `duration: 137` or a bespoke cubic-bezier — they
 * pick a named step from here. If a component genuinely needs a unique
 * physical model, add a named entry rather than an inline value.
 *
 * Principles (Emil Kowalski / Apple HIG):
 *   - animate transform + opacity; never layout properties
 *   - exits are faster than entrances
 *   - no bounce unless physically justified
 *   - every animation must be interruptible
 *   - motion must earn its place: fewer, better animations
