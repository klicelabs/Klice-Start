/**
 * Shared Liquid Glass material family (CSS half of the system).
 *
 * The optical half lives in `apps/extension/src/lib/glass.ts`:
 * `glassIntensityParams()` interpolates the global `glassIntensity` 0…100
 * slider into the LiquidGlass props (blur / refraction / saturation / bezel)
 * consumed through GlassSurface:
 *
 *   intensity 0   Ultra Clear:  clear blur 1.5, dense blur 8,
 *                               refraction 12, low veil opacity
 *   intensity 60  Default:      clear blur 3.6, dense blur 10.4,
 *                               refraction 26, restrained veil opacity
 *   intensity 100 Fully Tinted: clear blur 5, dense blur 12,
 *                               refraction 36, denser veil opacity
 * (saturation pairs are dark / light: Light stays near-neutral so the
 * toolbar can't pick up a blue cast from the wallpaper.)
 *
 * Hard ceiling: blur never exceeds 12px (MAX_LIQUID_GLASS_BLUR). The CSS
 * below is intentionally static — blur/backdrop/refraction are NEVER
 * animated (transform/opacity only), and prefers-contrast: more is served
 * by selecting the dense tier, never by brightening this file.
 *
 * LENS NOTE: nodes rendered through `<LiquidGlass>` get their
 * backdrop-filter from INLINE style, which overrides the Tailwind
 * backdrop-* utilities below — so on-lens density must come from `bg-*`
 * opacity + lens props (blur / brightness / saturation) only. The
 * backdrop-* utilities here serve only the CSS-class path (glassMaterial
 * on plain divs). Recipes are light-first with `dark:` overrides (the
 * `.dark` class is set by AppearanceProvider).
